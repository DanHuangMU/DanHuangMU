		<h1>NOT ONLY A PHOTOGRAHER</h1>
		<h1>BUT ALSO A LIFE RECORDER</h1>
		<p>My dad's name is Weihua Huang, who was born and raised in China. The art of photography is part of his life. As an amateur photographer, he lays his footprints on many fabulous places with beautiful scenery, astonishing landscapes, charming people, and inspiring culture. Currently, he is member of Global Photographic Union, Royal Photographic Society, and Photographic Society of America (China). Since April 2016, he has been actively participating 30+ international shows and contests for photography and received nominations for 160+ of my artefacts. Multiple photographs of his were granted gold and silver medals, prizes from the nominating committee, and honor belt awards. It is his dream to see, record, read, and understand the unknown Chinese lands and cultures through my lenses, and to open an exhibition of my work under the theme of “A Different World”.</p>

				<h1>Never The Goal But An Affirmative Answer</h1>
				<p>My father always believes that the pasion is the most important thing of doing everything, like photography. He would like to consider awards as the approval of such pasion. Although he has obtained some awards in the past years, his goal is still photography itself. Here, will introduce some of his awards.</p>

			<h1>When<br>You Could Be More Than A Photographer</h1>
			<p>As an amateur photographer, my father has the opportunity to get to know all kinds of groups and places. He has lots of impressive experiences to share. Some of them are touching and heart-warming, some of them are adventurous, and others are bitter. Here, he would like to share the story happend in a poor mountain area. He has took a series of photograpich works for the children and the elders living in that place to show people the living condition there.</p>
