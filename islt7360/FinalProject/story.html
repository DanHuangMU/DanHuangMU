		As an amateur photographer, my father has the opportunity to visit different places and get to know all kinds of people. Therefore every story in his photographic life is an unforgettable experience which is meaningful, including the one below:<br> At the first time he travelled to Liangshan, he was fascinated by the view there. But he also found that the fabulous mountian view to the photographers is a poverty-stricken areas to the people living there, and most of them are the elder and children. <br>After getting to know these kind and simple people, my father became a volunteer there who is devoted to help such groups.<br>Also, He calls for more attentions on Liangshan area through his photographic works. He went to Liangshan more than ten times to complete a series of work named "The Deep Mountain" and published it. Hopefully, through this work, people can notice this place, and help them with their living condition and education.<br><hr/>

			<h2 style="position: absolute;top: 24%;left: 5%;font-size:1.5vw;margin-right: 15px;">"Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan is located in Southwest Mountain Range in China. It is the largest traditional settlement of minority people known as “Yi” in China with more than two million Yi inhabitants. It is a beautiful place which is an ideal land for a photographer. But it is also the most poverty-stricken areas in the country. During years, I visited Liangshan more than ten times. Not only to take photographes, but also to help the poeple there, especially the children and elders." <br><span style="float: right;">-- Weihua Huang</span></h2>
