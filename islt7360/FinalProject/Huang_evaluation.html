			<h2>Summary of Evaluatiors' Comments:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Summary:</h4>
					<p>Accroding to the feedback, I found that people with different background will provide suggestions on different parts. Suggestions from Yidong are related to the portfolio which he is interested in. He felt that he could not get enough information only from photographs. He would like to get more information like from where this photo was taken. Also, he mentioned that it was not a good idea to link the portfolio to Google Photo, because it would let the users like him ignore the website and go to the Google photo directly. The biggest issue that Susan encountered is the navigation bar. She felt frustrated to keep closing new opening pages. Also, she didn't think the "Gallery" is good name, because it could make people confused with portfolio page. Dorothy was a little confused about the story webpage, because the content didn't tell the stroy clear enough.</p>

		<div id="case">
			<h2>Use Cases:</h2>
			<p>The purpose of my website is to introduce my father as an amateur photographer and share his works and stories. Based on this purpose, I was proposed three use cases: creating three different html files to introduce three different parts; sharing photographic works through collaging images on portfolio webpage and link all the photos to the Google Photo; using a photo which related to the story as the background on the story webpage. After the user testing, I concluded the feedbacks on these use cases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>All the evaluators are satisfied with the layout and the navigation. They could easily visit all the webpages, and tell the different parts clearly. But since I added target = "_blank" function, the evaluators felt frustrated to keep closing new opening pages.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>They are also like the collaging layout of portfolio webpage. But there are still suggestions: the evaluators who are interested in photography would like to know more information about the photographic works. And it's questionable to link photos to Google Photo.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The background photo is successfully made the webpage more eye-catching. The evaluators are impressived on this.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="changes">
			<h2>Recommended/Planned Changes to the Design:</h2>
			<p>Based on the feedbacks, I would like to do the following changes on my design:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Since Yidong mentioned that he would like to get the information about photos, I would like to add a feature that when the user hover over a photo, it will show the place that this photo was taken. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>I think what Yidong said about linking to Google Photo is reasonable. So I would like to delete this feature.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>I would like to change the header of the homepage. Because Susan mentioned that it could be confused with portfolio page.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Also, evaluators felt inconvenient to keep closing new opening webpages, I will delete the target = "_blank" function in the navigation bar.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Accordingn to Dorothy's suggestion,I would like to add another panel on the story webpage, to introduce some details about the story. </p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="reflection">
			<h2>Reflections on My Evaluation Process:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Based on the evaluation process. I think the most efficient way to gather useful information is to combine the observation and interview. In this assignment, I used different ways to collect data:1. I showed Yidong the website first, and then ask him questions from the evaluation from instead of sending him the word document; 2. I showed Susan the website, and observe how she visit the website, and then give her the evaluation from; 3. I filled out the URL of my website, and then send the word document to Dorothy. It turned out that the first and second way yielded more useful information. And the Dorothyâ€™s data provided little useful information. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>First of all, I realized that the user testing is very important. Gathering different suggestions from different perspectives can provide me a better idea of modifying the design or the content. Secondly, I learned the efficient way to collect the useful data.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Moreover, I noticed that the user with different background will notice different issues. For instance, Dororthy was tend to focus on the content and how to convey the information due to her communication and information knowledge. Therefore, gathering data from people with different background could be more fruitful.</p>
